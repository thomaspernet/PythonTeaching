    "## The functions\n",
    "\n",
    "As in other programming languages ​​offering a functional paradigm, a function in Python is a named code brick, reusable and dedicated to perform a specific task.\n",
    "\n",
    "A function accepts as input arguments that will be used to produce a result (returned in general thanks to the return).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why write a function?\n",
    "\n",
    "The motivation behind writing a function is to avoid redundancy, ie to use multiple times the same code brick. Writing it as a function will make it possible to generalize the code brick to several use cases, and call this single function several times instead of finding the brick of repeatedly code in the program. This will have the advantages of making the code more compact and readable, and easier to maintain afterwards. Functions provide an approach modular and flexible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember to write a function as soon as an identical need appears more than once.\n",
    "\n",
    "That's why we sometimes hear that a good developer tends to be lazy: rather than code a number of times, it will seek to generalize to optimize its efforts - and the function is the ideal tool for this.\n",
    "\n",
    "Important Distinction: A Python function is always used followed by parentheses (even empty)."
